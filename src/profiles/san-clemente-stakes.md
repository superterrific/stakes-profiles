The San Clemente has generally been a formful race where favorites have only slightly underperformed the [generally accepted average favorite win rate of 35%](http://agameofskill.com/how-well-do-horse-racing-favorites-perform/) to win 32.1% of the time since 1991. It’s been a different story over the last 10 years with favorites only winning twice.

Thanks to a fair share of double digit payouts, average winning odds since 1991 are 7-1 with a median of 5.3-1 and an average $16.10 payout for a $2 win ticket. Since 2010 those averages have ticked up to 7.5-1 and $17.00 to win with median odds of 5.9-0. Notably 7 of the last 10 winners have paid over $10 to win.

The winner on average has been the 3rd choice (3.29) since 1991 and almost 4th (3.91) choice since 2010. The favorite has an average finish position of 2nd (2.71) since 1991 and 2.56 since 2010.

Stalker/pressers have had a slight edge over off-the-pace runners since 1991 but off-the-pace has produced 50% of the last 10 winners.

Winners have predominately come from California since 1991 and that trend has remained in tact over the last 10 years. However 30% of the last winners made their prior start at a track outside of California. Field size has been well above the [2017 average of 7.7 starters](http://jockeyclub.com/factbook/races_pass.asp?whatyr=2017) with an average of 9.11 starters since 1991 and 9.55 starters since 2010.
