The Kentucky Jockey Club has been a notably consistent and formful race since 1991 with no double digit odds winners in the time frame.

The average winning odds since 1991 are 3.7-1 with a median of 3.4-1 and an average $9.40 payout for a $2 win ticket. Since 2010 those numbers have dipped to average odds of 3.5-1, median odds of 3.4-1 and $9.00 to win.

Favorites have performed close to the [generally accepted average favorite win rate of 35%](http://agameofskill.com/how-well-do-horse-racing-favorites-perform/) to win 35.7% of the time since 1991 and 30% in the last 10 years.

The winner on average has been the 2nd choice (2.36) since 1991 and dropped slightly (1.89) since 2010. The favorite has had an average finish position of 3rd (3.61) since 1991, also dropping slightly to 3.73 since 2010. In the last decade winners have been no worse than 3rd choice.

Stalkers/Pressers have performed best since 1991 winning 50% of the time, a trend that has continued over the last 10 years.

Not surprisingly winners have come mostly from the host track of Churchill Downs. In the last ten years Belmont has sent two winners. Field size has been slightly above the [2017 average of 7.7 starters](http://jockeyclub.com/factbook/races_pass.asp?whatyr=2017) with an average of 9.82 starters since 1991 and jumped to an average of 11.56 starters since 2010.
