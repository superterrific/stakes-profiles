The Delaware Handicap has generally been a formful race since 1991 but especially so in the last 10 years.

The average winning odds since 1991 are 6.4-1 with a median of 2.2-1 and an average $14.40 payout for a $2 win ticket. Since 2010 those averages have dipped to 1.3-1 odds with a median of $.60 and $4.60 to win.

Favorites have outperformed the [generally accepted average favorite win rate of 35%](http://agameofskill.com/how-well-do-horse-racing-favorites-perform/) to win 41.3% of the time since 1991. In the last 10 years the favorite has won 70% of the time. The winner on average has been almost 3rd choice (2.61) since 1991 but has dropped to about 2nd choice since 2010 (1.73).

Speed and stalker/pressers have won equally (34.4%) since 1991 but in last 10 years speed has had the edge to win 40% of the time.

The majority of both winners and starters have been 4-year-olds. 5-year-olds have not entered as often as 4-year-olds but have won almost as often when comparing wins relative to numbers of starts. There have been no 3-year-olds entered since 1991. Starters who have made a prior start in the Delaware Handicap, known as run backs, have won 13.3% of the time and run in the money 40% of the time.

Winners have some from a range of tracks since 1991 but four of the seven winners from Churchill Downs did so in the last 10 years. Since 1991 the average field size has been slightly above the [2017 average of 7.7 starters](http://jockeyclub.com/factbook/races_pass.asp?whatyr=2017) with an average of 8 starters, but since 2010 that number has dropped dramatically to 6.5 average starters.
