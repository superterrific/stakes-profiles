ageIntro: "4-year-olds have been the most frequent starters (33.8%) and winners (39.2%) of the Breeders’ Cup Mile since 1991. 25% of the winners have 3-year-olds while 21% have 5-year-olds, but 5-year-olds have started a bit more frequently than 3-year-olds. 6-, 7- and 8-year-olds make up 14% of all starters in the time frame"
ageSummary: "Looking at the performance of each age group, 6-year-olds had the highest win rate to relative starters at 9.6% but there isn't that much difference between the age groups given the larger overall number of starters as compared to non-Breeders' Cup stakes races. 6- and 7-year-olds have outperformed their expected odds."
