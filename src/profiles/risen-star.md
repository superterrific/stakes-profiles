The Risen Star has generally been a good betting race. The average winning odds since 1991 are 8.6-1 with a median of 2.8-1 and an average $19.10 payout for a $2 win ticket. Since 2010 those averages have shot up to odds of 18.6-1 and $38.90 to win, largely thanks to longshot winners **I’ve Struck a Nerve** (2013) and **Bravazo** (2018). Medians since 2010 were also up, although less dramatically, to odds of 4.4-1 and $9.60 to win.

Favorites have under performed the 2017 average win rate of 37.89%, winning only 29% of the time since 1991. The winner on average has been the 2nd choice (2.65) since 1991 but, like odds and payouts, has crept up to 3rd choice (3.33) since 2010.

Off the pace runners have won 32.2% of the time and stalker/pressers have won 29% of the time. Wire-to-wire winners have had the least success since 1991 winning only 16.3% of the time.

Winners have predominantly come from Fair Grounds, but in the last 10 years 40% of the winners have come from either Fair Grounds or Gulfstream. Field size has been far above the [2017 average of 7.7 starters](http://jockeyclub.com/factbook/races_pass.asp?whatyr=2017) with an average of 9.71 starters since 1991 and an average of 11.46 starters since 2010.
