The majority of both winners and starters have been 4-year-olds. 5-year-olds have entered a bit less often than 4-year-olds but have won almost as often when comparing wins relative to numbers of starts. There have been no 3-, 7-, or 9-year-old winners since 1991. Starters who have made a prior start in the Arlington Million, known as run backs, have not performed well, winning only 6.9% of the time.

Winners have come primarily from Belmont Park since 1991. International runners have also done well in the time frame but have not come from a single track. Since 1991 the average field size has been notably above the [2017 average of 7.7 starters](http://jockeyclub.com/factbook/races_pass.asp?whatyr=2017) with an average of 10.12 starters, since 2010 that number has increased to 10.56 average starters.
