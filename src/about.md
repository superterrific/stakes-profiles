This project originated as a section within the [Hello Race Fans](https://helloracefans.com) Thoroughbred horse racing fan education site. It was active between 2018 and 2019 and looked at a variety of data points for a handful of [graded stakes races](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graded_stakes_race) from 1991 to 2018 (and in some cases 2019).

The profiles are a series of data visualizations created to answer simple questions like “how have favorites performed in this race historically?” and “what kind of running styles have performed well, or not”.

The charts use [Google charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/) and data manually compiled from [Equibase](http://www.equibase.com), the "official supplier of racing information and statistics" in North America.

Google charts provided a relatively straightforward way to produce simple charts, but presented a host of issues, mainly around accessibility and performance. For more information see the [Accessibility Statement](/accessibility-statement) for details.

This project was conceived, created and maintained by [Dana Byerly](https://danabyerly.com) and is built with hand-written HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The favicon and social image is from [Emoji Terra](https://emojiterra.com/pt/tendencia-de-crescimento/). See here for information about the [concept and implementation of the project](https://danabyerly.com/projects/stakes-profiles/).
