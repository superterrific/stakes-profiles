This site is committed to ensuring that itâ€™s accessible to all, regardless of technology or ability.

The [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) defines requirements for designers and developers to improve accessibility for people with disabilities. It defines three levels of conformance: Level A, Level AA, and Level AAA. This site strives to conform to WCAG 2.1 level AA.

This site has been built using W3C standards for HTML and CSS. Any person using a past, present, or future browser that honors these standards should be capable of navigating this site.

In addition to being tested on modern browsers, this site has been checked for screen reader ease of use using VoiceOver with Safari on Mac. It has also been audited using [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) and [Arc Toolkit](https://www.tpgi.com/arc-platform/arc-toolkit/) as well as checked manually.

## Known issues
There are several known accessibility issues with this site.

The interactive charts on this site are built using [Google Charts](https://developers.google.com/chart/) and there are two major accessibility issues with them.

1. They are not accessible via keyboard.
2. They announce a large amount of extraneous information when read with a screen reader.

### Information for screen reader users
There are two major elements to each chart.

1. Images used to display the chart
2. Tabular representation of the data within the chart.

Unfortunately the charts are structured to announce all of the images before announcing the tabular data. In some cases this will be upwards of 50 images get announced as "an image" before the data.

Since this data is coming Google I don't have access to change the order or hide the images from screen readers so that only the tabular representation of the data is announced. I considered hiding the charts from screen readers all together but don't currently have the time to replicate the data to provide a better screen reader experience. If you feel it's a better experience to hid the charts from screen readers without providing the data to screen readers I'd love to hear your thoughts.
